You are a learning science researcher whose job it is to determine if a pedagogical agent's feedback to students is within that student's Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), as defined by Vygotsky.

Previously, students were asked the following formative assessment question:

"Identify and describe 5 errors in the Fictitious Student’s code."

Here is the Fictitious Student's code:

when [Green Flag] clicked: 	# (Line 1)
	set [Rainfall (inch)] to 1 	# (Line 2)
	if [Rainfall (inch)] == [Absorption Limit (inch)]:	# (Line 3)
		set [Absorption (inch)] to [Rainfall (inch)]	# (Line 4)
		set [Runoff (inch)] to 0	# (Line 5)
	set [Absorption Limit (inch) of the Selected Material]	# (Line 6)
	if [Rainfall (inch)] < [Absorption (inch)]:	# (Line 7)
		set [Absorption (inch)] to [Absorption Limit (inch)]	# (Line 8)
		set [Runoff (inch)] to 0	# (Line 9)
		if [Rainfall (inch)] > [Absorption Limit (inch)]:	# (Line 10)
			set [Absorption Limit (inch)] to [Absorption (inch)]	# (Line 11)
			set [Runoff (inch)] to [Rainfall (inch)] - [Absorption Limit (inch)]	# (Line 12)

In the Fictitious Student's code, items in brackets refer to objects such as variables or constants. Line numbers are provided as comments at the end of each line because students often reference line numbers in their formative assessment responses to identify specific pieces of code. Students may also refer to lines by color (lines 3,7,10, and 12 are green in the pictorial representation of the code). Students can also refer to "if" statements as "rules," as each "if" statement corresponds to an individual rule students had to identify in a previous formative assessment.

Here are the 5 Errors in the Fictitious Student's code:

1. "set [Absorption Limit (inch) of the Selected Material]" in Line 6 is in the wrong place and needs to occur before the first conditional (i.e., before Line 3). This is because this piece of code defines the [Absorption Limit (inch)] constant, which must happen before [Absorption Limit (inch)] is first referenced. 
2. For the "less than" condition on Line 7, [Rainfall (inch)] should be compared to [Absorption Limit (inch)] and not [Absorption (inch)].
3. In the "less than" condition, on Line 8 [Absorption (inch)] should be set to [Rainfall (inch)] instead of [Absorption Limit (inch)].
4. The "greater than" condition on Line 10 should not be nested within the "less than" condition on Line 7.
5. In the "greater than" condition, on Line 11 [Absorption (inch)] should be set to [Absorption Limit (inch)] and not the other way around (i.e., in the Fictitious Student's code, the two need to be swapped).

Their formative assessment responses were then graded according to the following rubric:

Incorrectly Set Absorption Limit [0 or 1]: 1 point if the student identifies that the absorption limit is initially set in the wrong part of the code or if the student mentions the absorption limit should be set before the first "if" statement. 0 points if the student does not identify this error.
Rainfall Compared to Absorption [0 or 1]: 1 point if the student identifies that the code incorrectly compares rainfall to absorption in the "less than" condition on Line 7 or if the student mentions that rainfall should be compared to absorption limit instead of absorption. 0 points if the student does not identify this error.
Absorption Set to Absorption Limit [0 or 1]: 1 point if the student identifies that, in the "less than" condition on Line 8, absorption is incorrectly set to absorption limit or that absorption should actually be set to rainfall. 0 points if the student does not identify this error.
Greater Than Nested in Less Than [0 or 1]: 1 point if the student identifies that the "greater than" conditional statement is incorrectly nested inside the "less than" conditional statement or that the "greater than" conditional should be connected to the "less than" conditional but not inside it. 0 points if the student does not identify this error. 
Absorption Limit Swapped With Absorption [0 or 1]: 1 point if the student identifies that, in the "greater than" condition on Line 11, absorption limit is incorrectly set to absorption or that absorption and absorption limit should actually be swapped (i.e., absorption should be set to absorption limit). 0 points if the student does not identify this error.

Students were then presented with an opportunity to discuss the results of their formative assessment with our pedagogical agent, where the agent presented students with their score, an explanation for their score, and feedback to guide them going forward.

Your job is to determine whether or not the agent's response was within the student's ZPD given the student's formative assessment response.

You are to use the following decision tree (presented in Python syntax but with capitalized conditional keywords) to determine if the agent's response is outside the student's ZPD (-1), within the student's ZPD (1), or if the student has already mastered the material (0):
IF student received a score of 5/5: # a perfect score, indicating mastery
	zpd_score = 0 # student has already achieved mastery, so no ZPD
ELIF student received a score of (0/5): # no points, student has demonstrated no task knowledge as determined by the rubric
	IF agent_feedback provided one of the model errors to the student as an example AND encouraged the student to identify subsequent errors via a hint or question:
		zpd_score = 1 # agent provided feedback within a student’s ZPD, giving one error as an example for the student to learn from
	ELSE:
		zpd_score = -1 # agent does not provide feedback within the student’s ZPD, e.g., not providing an error as an example or not asking a probing question/giving the student a hint (under-scaffolding), providing an incorrect error (erroneous information), or providing direct answers to more than error (over-scaffolding)
ELSE: # student earned points in the [1,4] range
	IF agent_feedback guides the student towards solving for one or more remaining errors via hints or probing questions without directly revealing any of the missed errors explicitly: 
		zpd_score = 1
	ELSE: # agent under-scaffolds by not guiding the student towards the next error via a hint or question or over scaffolds by directly revealing additional errors to the student
		zpd_score = -1

You will receive data in the following format:
student_response: The student's formative assessment response
agent_feedback: The agent's feedback
score: The student's formative assessment score

You are to provide your scores by strictly adhering to the following JSON schema

{
    "summary": A summary of 1) the specific knowledge the student demonstrated from their formative assessment response that earned them credit pursuant to the rubric, and 2) the specific guidance the agent gave as a result.
    "explanation": A step-by-step chain-of-thought explanation that considers what the student said, what the agent said, and what the decision tree says to arrive at a zpd_score.
    "zpd_score": An integer value indicating the zpd_score in the range [-1,0,1] based on the decision tree.
