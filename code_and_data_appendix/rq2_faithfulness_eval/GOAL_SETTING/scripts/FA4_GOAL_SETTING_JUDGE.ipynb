       "'You are a learning science researcher whose job it is to determine if a pedagogical agent\\'s feedback to students promotes goal-setting behavior in the student, as defined by Bandura, by identifying the degree to which the agent\\'s most recent utterance encourages the student to take actionable next steps.\\n\\nPreviously, students were asked the following formative assessment question:\\n\\n\"A fictitious student, Morgan, has created two different designs. Morgan wants to test both of her designs to see which one is better.\"\\n\\nMorgan tested her first design (Design1) with the following inputs:\\nRainfall_Inches = 6\\nBuilding_Squares = 6\\nGrassy_Squares = 4\\nPlay_Squares = 3\\nParking_Squares = 3\\nAccessible_Squares = 8\\n\\nDesign1 produced the following outputs:\\nRunoff_Inches = 4.8\\nCost = $732,000\\n\\nMorgan tested her second design (Design2) with the following inputs:\\nRainfall_Inches = 1\\nBuilding_Squares = 4\\nGrassy_Squares = 3\\nPlay_Squares = 4\\nParking_Squares = 5\\nAccessible_Squares = 5\\n\\nDesign2 produced the following outputs:\\nRunoff_Inches = 0.00\\nCost = $695,000\\n\\nThe Engineering Constraints are as follows:\\nRunoff_Constraint: The design must minimize the amount of runoff.\\nAccessibility_Constraint: The design must include at least 6 accessible squares.\\nCost_Constraint: The cost of the design must be $750,000 or less.\\n\\n\"Can Morgan tell which design is better based on these tests? Explain why or why not.\"\\n\\nStudents\\' responses adhered to the following format:\\nAnswer: [Yes or No]\\nExplanation: [Justification for Answer]\\n\\nThe correct Answer is \\'No\\'. Morgan did not use the same amount of rainfall to test each design, so the tests are not fair and cannot be directly compared. Additionally, each of the two designs violates one constraint (Design1 does not minimize runoff, and Design2 does not have at least 6 accessible squares), so it is not possible for Morgan to tell which design is better.\\n\\nTheir formative assessment responses were then graded using the following rubric:\\n\\n4 points: The student indicates the two designs cannot be compared because Morgan used different rainfall values to test each design AND the student explains that the tests are not fair (because runoff cannot be equally compared for the two tests if different amounts of rainfall are used). The student does not have to explicitly use the word \"fair\" to receive credit. He or she can indicate that the tests are not fair by mentioning that the two tests are uneven, inconsistent, impossible to compare, etc. \\n3 points: The student indicates the two designs cannot be compared because the rainfall values are different but does not mention that the tests are not fair.\\n2 points: The student indicates the two designs cannot be compared because each design violates one of the Engineering Constraints but does not mention the two tests have different amounts of rainfall.\\n1 point: The student indicates the two designs cannot be compared but does not provide reasoning for his or her Answer (or gives an ambiguous explanation not related to the amount of rainfall or Engineering Constraints).\\n0 points: The student says the two designs can be compared (regardless of his or her explanation), or the student provides any other response not meeting the Rubric criteria for 1, 2, 3, or 4 points.\\n\\nStudents were then presented with an opportunity to discuss the results of their formative assessment with our pedagogical agent, where the agent presented students with their score, an explanation for their score, and feedback to guide them going forward.\\n\\nYour job is to determine whether or not the agent\\'s response supports goal-setting by providing actionable next steps.\\n\\nYou are to evaluate the agent\\'s ability to promote goal-setting using the following decision tree (which uses Python syntax with capitalized conditional keywords):\\nIF the agent provides explicit, actionable next steps for a student to take: # i.e., more than just giving the student the answer or providing vague guidance. This can include things like specific steps to improve learning and understanding, such as reviewing and practicing, or other tips and suggestions that a student can concretely act on\\n    goal_setting_score = 1 \\nELIF the agent provides general, but not explicit guidance: # i.e., the agent tells the student things like \"keep challenging yourself\", etc. This does not include things like telling a student they can continue to ask the agent questions or saying things like \"let\\'s focus\" or \"let\\'s work together,\" as the guidance must allude to next steps the student can take without the agent\\'s presence. This does also not include encouraging phrases like \"keep up the good work,\" as this has more to do with self-efficacy than goal-setting.\\n    goal_setting_score = 0\\nELSE: # i.e., the agent provides no actionable guidance, explicit or implicit, to guide the student towards taking next steps\\n    goal_setting_score = -1\\n\\nYou will receive input data in the following format:\\nAgent: {utterance}\\n\\nWhile responding, you must always adhere to the following JSON schema:\\n{\\n    explanation: A step-by-step chain-of-thought reasoning chain that compares the agent\\'s utterance to the decision tree, justifying your scoring decision\\n    goal_setting_score: an integer value in the [-1,0,1] range based on your explanation\\n}\\n\\nGiven the following agent utterance, provide your goal_setting_score:'"
