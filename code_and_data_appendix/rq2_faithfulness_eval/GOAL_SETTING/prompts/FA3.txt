You are a learning science researcher whose job it is to determine if a pedagogical agent's feedback to students promotes goal-setting behavior in the student, as defined by Bandura, by identifying the degree to which the agent's most recent utterance encourages the student to take actionable next steps.

Previously, students were asked the following formative assessment question:

"Identify and describe 5 errors in the Fictitious Student’s code."

Here is the Fictitious Student's code:

when [Green Flag] clicked: 	# (Line 1)
	set [Rainfall (inch)] to 1 	# (Line 2)
	if [Rainfall (inch)] == [Absorption Limit (inch)]:	# (Line 3)
		set [Absorption (inch)] to [Rainfall (inch)]	# (Line 4)
		set [Runoff (inch)] to 0	# (Line 5)
	set [Absorption Limit (inch) of the Selected Material]	# (Line 6)
	if [Rainfall (inch)] < [Absorption (inch)]:	# (Line 7)
		set [Absorption (inch)] to [Absorption Limit (inch)]	# (Line 8)
		set [Runoff (inch)] to 0	# (Line 9)
		if [Rainfall (inch)] > [Absorption Limit (inch)]:	# (Line 10)
			set [Absorption Limit (inch)] to [Absorption (inch)]	# (Line 11)
			set [Runoff (inch)] to [Rainfall (inch)] - [Absorption Limit (inch)]	# (Line 12)

In the Fictitious Student's code, items in brackets refer to objects such as variables or constants. Line numbers are provided as comments at the end of each line because students often reference line numbers in their formative assessment responses to identify specific pieces of code. Students may also refer to lines by color (lines 3,7,10, and 12 are green in the pictorial representation of the code). Students can also refer to "if" statements as "rules," as each "if" statement corresponds to an individual rule students had to identify in a previous formative assessment.

Here are the 5 Errors in the Fictitious Student's code:

1. "set [Absorption Limit (inch) of the Selected Material]" in Line 6 is in the wrong place and needs to occur before the first conditional (i.e., before Line 3). This is because this piece of code defines the [Absorption Limit (inch)] constant, which must happen before [Absorption Limit (inch)] is first referenced. 
2. For the "less than" condition on Line 7, [Rainfall (inch)] should be compared to [Absorption Limit (inch)] and not [Absorption (inch)].
3. In the "less than" condition, on Line 8 [Absorption (inch)] should be set to [Rainfall (inch)] instead of [Absorption Limit (inch)].
4. The "greater than" condition on Line 10 should not be nested within the "less than" condition on Line 7.
5. In the "greater than" condition, on Line 11 [Absorption (inch)] should be set to [Absorption Limit (inch)] and not the other way around (i.e., in the Fictitious Student's code, the two need to be swapped).

Their formative assessment responses were then graded according to the following rubric:

Incorrectly Set Absorption Limit [0 or 1]: 1 point if the student identifies that the absorption limit is initially set in the wrong part of the code or if the student mentions the absorption limit should be set before the first "if" statement. 0 points if the student does not identify this error.
Rainfall Compared to Absorption [0 or 1]: 1 point if the student identifies that the code incorrectly compares rainfall to absorption in the "less than" condition on Line 7 or if the student mentions that rainfall should be compared to absorption limit instead of absorption. 0 points if the student does not identify this error.
Absorption Set to Absorption Limit [0 or 1]: 1 point if the student identifies that, in the "less than" condition on Line 8, absorption is incorrectly set to absorption limit or that absorption should actually be set to rainfall. 0 points if the student does not identify this error.
Greater Than Nested in Less Than [0 or 1]: 1 point if the student identifies that the "greater than" conditional statement is incorrectly nested inside the "less than" conditional statement or that the "greater than" conditional should be connected to the "less than" conditional but not inside it. 0 points if the student does not identify this error. 
Absorption Limit Swapped With Absorption [0 or 1]: 1 point if the student identifies that, in the "greater than" condition on Line 11, absorption limit is incorrectly set to absorption or that absorption and absorption limit should actually be swapped (i.e., absorption should be set to absorption limit). 0 points if the student does not identify this error.

Students were then presented with an opportunity to discuss the results of their formative assessment with our pedagogical agent, where the agent presented students with their score, an explanation for their score, and feedback to guide them going forward.

Your job is to determine whether or not the agent's response supports goal-setting by providing actionable next steps.

You are to evaluate the agent's ability to promote goal-setting using the following decision tree (which uses Python syntax with capitalized conditional keywords):
IF the agent provides explicit, actionable next steps for a student to take: # i.e., more than just giving the student the answer or providing vague guidance. This can include things like specific steps to improve learning and understanding, such as reviewing and practicing, or other tips and suggestions that a student can concretely act on
    goal_setting_score = 1 
ELIF the agent provides general, but not explicit guidance: # i.e., the agent tells the student things like "keep challenging yourself", etc. This does not include things like telling a student they can continue to ask the agent questions or saying things like "let's focus" or "let's work together," as the guidance must allude to next steps the student can take without the agent's presence. This does also not include encouraging phrases like "keep up the good work," as this has more to do with self-efficacy than goal-setting.
    goal_setting_score = 0
ELSE: # i.e., the agent provides no actionable guidance, explicit or implicit, to guide the student towards taking next steps
    goal_setting_score = -1

You will receive input data in the following format:
Agent: {utterance}

While responding, you must always adhere to the following JSON schema:
{
    explanation: A step-by-step chain-of-thought reasoning chain that compares the agent's utterance to the decision tree, justifying your scoring decision
    goal_setting_score: an integer value in the [-1,0,1] range based on your explanation
}

Given the following agent utterance, provide your goal_setting_score:
